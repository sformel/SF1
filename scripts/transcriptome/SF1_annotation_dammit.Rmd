## Annotating with dammit

Used dammit version 1.2

But I couldn't get the python doe to render here.  So I'm going to just run it in terminal and keep a record for now.
```{python}

Quite silly, but BUSCO won't take the file because "Google Drive" has a space in it.  And I can't seem to escape out of it. So I'm running this annotation in a different folder and moving it to SF1 afterward.

dammit annotate /Users/stephenformel/Google\ Drive/VB_lab/VBL_users/Grad_Students/Steve/SF1/data/transcriptome/SF1_Trinity_24Mar2019_output/Trinity.fasta --busco-group eukaryota --n_threads 4
